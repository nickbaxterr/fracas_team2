## 1 recap from last meeting

Insan: Decision from last meeting - We're using flask, react\
Sqlite for user backend\
Mongodb for failure reports

Insan: ant.design - showcase of ant component library.

Comments:

Peter, Nicholas: Typescript shouldn't be a problem\
Harsha: looks good. Suggestion - can also use Google Material.ui. Ant design looks cool but material ui might have more documentation.

Insan: Material.ui looks good as well - up to people for frontend.

Insan: (Doing a cursory search) Ant design is new but material ui has good docs. Material ui more safer.

Insan: Set up a react base. Haven't pushed it has some errors, will push tonight.
Plan ahead - think about database schema, plans for website.

Haoyuan: Question - we have action items. Do we have to update action items every meeting? Anything I can help?\
Insan: All good - can you charge database?\
Haoyuan: sounds good to me, backend good.

Insan: Things to do (for Haoyuan):

- Look into mongodb
- Look more into requirements document - plan db schema from this
- Integrate into flask code.
  Let us know if there's anything you need.

Insan: Igor - handling testing side?\
Igor: Not exactly my specialty\
Insan: Need another pair of eyes (manual testing). Write fake user accounts, fake reports.\

Insan: Four of us - focus on building prototype.\
Prototype of pages (Nicholas - I can have a look of that.)

Insan: Peter, Harsha Work closely (text later)

Insan: Sprint 1 Goals:

1. adding failure reports (interface)
2. Login
3. page to see failure reports submitted.

## 2 Agenda for client

1. Propose web app (clarify what solution we are doing).
2. Rate priority of requirement (simplify requirements)
3. Talk about hosting/vps. Discuss setting it up on uni internal intranet for now.

Insan: Peter - simplify the requirements. Don't include basic stuff (like filter). Higher level.

Peter: pt 2. Insan: makes a big difference if it's internal/exposed. might have to think abt security. Harsha: we can separate from the open internet (intranet).

Harsha: Selenium tests, automated reports - hand reports to client. Insan: Igor look at selenium testing.

Insan: when can you get db schema for sqlite side? Haoyuan: Friday.

Insan: Nicholas look at requirements for pages when? Nicholas: Friday.

Insan: Put team meetings on your booked hours.

Peter: meet at ezone 15 mins before. Insan: put image.

Harsha: Question for Nicholas - rough idea of how to approach layout? Nicholas: happy to hear suggestions.
